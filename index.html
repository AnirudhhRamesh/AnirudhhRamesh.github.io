      <p>
        Friends call me Arnie. I'm 22, born in Brussels, to South Indian
        parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a MSc (grad) CS student @ ETHZ and did my BSc (undergrad) CS at
        EPFL.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a strong coder who can also do marketing (12.5K followers, 3M views
        on LinkedIn) and sales (closed CHF 1K+ and soon much more).

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm set on building a company as I love building things & I love users
        using it. The effort to build a small successful company vs a
        unicorn-scale company is similar - so might as well go big.
      </p>
      --
      <p>
        Out of necessity, I'm building up the Zurich/Swiss AI/start-up ecosystem
        (then I'll go back to building). You might have seen me organize
        <a href="https://x.com/arnie_hacker/status/1887101974719402297"
          >AI Tinkerers Zurich</a
        >
        which had 300+ applicants (Google, Nvidia, YC, OpenAI, ...).
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll be launching many more events/hackathons and getting the Zurich
        ecosystem alive, connected & ambitious.
      </p>

            Built a Python CLI which generates entire blogs (even thumbnails)

          <p class="description">
            Re-built PyTorch/Micrograd from first principles. I did this during
            n&w while interning full-time at AWS. I followed Karpathy's
            Micrograd video as well as Stanford ML & DL specializations.
            Reviewed derivatives, backprop, I also derived sigmoid, binary cross
            entropy from scratch. Trained a hotdog classifier (the one from
            Silicon Valley xD).

            Alltoall(v), Allreduce. Came up with novel ideas like bloom filter
            for column-sharing protocol which led to 33% speedup.</span
