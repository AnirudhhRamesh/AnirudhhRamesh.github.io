        <h1>Anirudhh Ramesh</h1>
        <p>Friends call me Arnie. I'm 22. I'm a Master CS @ ETHZ, did undergrad CS at EPFL.</p>
        <p>After a failed YC interview, I realized that 1. money doesn't matter, fulfillment does. 2. Life is too short to not do what I love. 3. I have not figured out what I love yet. My solution to 3 is to learn as much as I can about the world. This starts with maths, physics, machine learning and robotics. I am aware my beliefs change over time. Dated Jul 25th, 2024.</p>
