        <h1>Anirudhh Ramesh</h1>
        <p>Friends call me Arnie. I'm 22. I'm a Master CS @ ETHZ, did undergrad CS at EPFL.</p>
        <p>I'm a strong coder who can also do marketing (11K followers, 3M views on LinkedIn) and sales (closed CHF 1K+ and soon much more). <a href="https://nav.al/build-sell">According to Naval Ravikant, that makes me 'unstoppable'</a></p>
        <p>I'm set on building a company. The effort to build a small successful company vs a unicorn-scale company is similar - so might as well go big.</p> 
        <p>I'm focused on speed, solving a problem for people I deeply empathize with, and building with great friends.</p>

        <h3>My past projects</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc">
            <li><a href="https://github.com/AnirudhhRamesh/BlogEditor">Blog Editor.</a> <span class="description">Built a Python CLI which generates entire blogs (even thumbnails) from a guest CV + photo + recorded interview. Uses Claude-3 Opus, contrastive Chain-of-though, few-shot.</span></li>
            <li><a href="http://github.com/anirudhhramesh/micrograd">ML Training & Inference Engine (from scratch)</a> <span class="description">Re-built PyTorch/Micrograd from first principles. Reviewed derivatives, backprop. Trained a hotdog classifier.</span></li>
