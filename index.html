        <p class="hardest-note">
          I worked full-time at Apple, completed 28 credits at ETH
          Zürich (~a full semester), went to gym 4× a week and organized the
          Zurich OpenAI Robotics Hack (where I fundraised ~$30K in commitments in
          1 week). This required working 12-14 hours every single day for 3
          months.

            <strong>CS:GO world models.</strong> I worked on robotics in Oct 2025;
            it confused me why VLAs use a VLM backbone. Thus, I started working on
            world models after my exams. Iterating on robots is very slow
            (requires real-world deployment), so I use CS:GO as my environment.
            I’m scraping game state (<code>.dem</code>) from FaceIt Pro matches,
            rendering gameplay, and training action-conditioned video diffusion /
            inverse dynamics / V-JEPA-style models.

              With my friend <a href="https://x.com/pham_blnh">Binh</a>, we were
              the first team in the world to deploy TWIST2 full-body teleop,
              fine-tuned GR00T N1.5 on full-body data and ran low-latency
              inference to Unitree G1 (which we got through a LinkedIn post).
              Learnt how far behind open-source is, how bad teleop is, how poorly
              VLAs generalize, how bad deployment testing is.

              I wanted to surround myself with extremely talented, ambitious
              people (the current events in Switzerland sucked). So I organized
              Europe’s most talent-dense robotics hack, bringing together
              researchers (Lucas Beyer, Marc Pollefeys, Marco Hutter), frontier
              companies (OpenAI, Mimic Robotics, Loki Robotics, Prime Intellect)
              and exceptional builders (ex-NASA, ex-NVIDIA, ex-DeepMind, ...).
              Followed up with a simulation hackathon with Nvidia, Flexion
              Robotics and Jua.ai.
