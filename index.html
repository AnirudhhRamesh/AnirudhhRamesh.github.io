        <h1>Anirudhh Ramesh</h1>
        <p>Friends call me Arnie. I'm 22. I'm a Master CS @ ETHZ, did undergrad CS at EPFL.</p>
        <p>After a failed start-up attempt, I realized that 1. money doesn't matter, fulfillment does. 2. Life is too short to not do what I love. 3. I have not figured out what I love yet. My solution to 3 is to learn as much as I can about the world. This starts with maths, physics, machine learning and robotics. I am aware my beliefs change over time. Dated Jul 25th, 2024.</p>

        <h3>Some places I worked</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc">
            <li>Software Engineer Intern @ Amazon Web Services</li>
            <p class="description">Learnt that networking *is* the internet. Worked in Network Monitoring. Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, SNS/SQS,. Shipped to prod.</p>
            
            <li>Software Engineer Intern @ Stacksync (YC W24)</li>
            <p class="description">Designed & implemented integration of ChargeBee, HubSpot and Auth0. Remote working is not for me.</p>

            <li>iOS App Developer @ Sleepiz </li>
            <p class="description">Built their iOS app in 2 months at age 16.</p>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>My side-quests</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc">
            <li><a href="http://github.com/anirudhhramesh/micrograd">MicroGrad</a> <span class="description">Re-built PyTorch from first principles. Reviewed derivatives, backprop. Trained a hotdog classifier. <a href="http://arnie-hotdog-classifier.streamlit.app">Demo</a>.</span></li>
            <li>Efficient, distributed sparse matrix-matrix multiplication. <span class="description">(6-Team project) Using MPI & C++, implemented a distributed sparse matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm. Did most design & implementation. Came up with & implemented novel ideas like bloom filter to minimize matrix column distribution across ranks.</span></li>
            <li>Weaviate VerbaChat RAG <span class="description">Re-made following their design. Learnt design patterns, RAG, full-stack.</span></li>
            <li>Ambitious x Driven <span class="description">Learnt mindset of outliers. They're driven by curiousity. Inspired 690 students, 1.5M views.</span></li>
            <li> <a href="http://gandalf-v2-cae5533834d4.herokuapp.com">LLM Prompt Injection game</a> <span class="description">Inspired by Gandalf, built in Python Flask. 550 users, 3.5K prompts generated.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Backlog of projects I want to build</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>GPT2 from scratch. <span class="description">Following Andrej Karpathy's lectures. Implement additional latest research improvements on top such as Flash Attention, Llama 3.1 paper. Deploy on custom 'chatgpt' site, built to be highly-scalable (AWS S3, Lambda, SageMaker)</span></li>
          <li>Stable Diffusion from scratch. <span class="description">Implement fine-tunes, try generate some stylized images of move shots (e.g. Anime-ified Taxi Driver).</span></li>
          <li>3D game engine from scratch. <span class="description">In C/C++. Use CUDA for efficient matrix operations. Implement shaders, raytracing.</span></li>
          <li>Robot Hand. <span class="description">Remote-operable, trackable joints, pressure-feedback. V0 with servos + cords. Try imitation learning and reinforcement learning.</span></li>
          <li>Autonomous Vehicle simulation. <span class="description">Build a simple end-to-end computer-vision model for autonomous vehicle. Build a simulation with multiple of these vehicle agents.</span></li>
          <li>Large-scale, distributed network simulation. <span class="description">Using C++ (or Scala), model network devices (states: operating, maintenance, failure) and links between them. Test out distributed packet-forwarding algorithms, anomaly detection, auto-remediation.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description">Many more things too :)</p>

        <h3>Some outlier things about me</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc">
            <li>At 14, started coding. Built a Flappy Bird clone in Unity & C#. Then self-learnt Android & iOS development. Built apps for my school and iOS app for Zurich start-up Sleepiz at 16.</li>
            <li>At 15, built a school clothing enterprise. Sold 1.3K clothes, generated â‚¬20K revenue</li>
            <li>At 16, joined a Sleepiz, a Swiss start-up, and built their entire iOS app in 2 months. Login/Auth, view/stream heartrate, breathing, movement data from their sleep-monitoring device. They raised 6.2M in 2022.</li>
            <li>More things: Generated 1.5M views through LinkedIn. Led 2 start-up investments through s2s.vc.</li>
