      <p>
        I'm a MSc (grad) CS student @ ETHZ and did my BSc (undergrad) CS at
        EPFL. Originally, I was born in Brussels to South Indian parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a strong coder who can also do marketing (12.5K followers, 3M views
        on LinkedIn) and sales (closed CHF ~20K for my blog & hackathons).

      <p>
        I'm set on building a research company as I love building things & I
        love users using it. The effort to build a small successful company vs a
        unicorn-scale company is similar - so might as well go big.
      </p>

        Out of necessity, I'm building up the Zurich/Swiss AI/start-up ecosystem
        (then I'll go back to building). You might have seen me organize

        which had 300+ applicants (Google, Nvidia, YC, NASA, ...).
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll be launching many more events/hackathons and getting the Zurich
        ecosystem kickstarted.

            Re-built PyTorch/Micrograd from first principles. I did this during
            n&w while interning full-time at AWS. I followed Karpathy's
            Micrograd video as well as Stanford ML & DL specializations.
            Reviewed derivatives, backprop, I also derived sigmoid, binary cross
            entropy from scratch. Trained a hotdog classifier (the one from
            Silicon Valley xD).
